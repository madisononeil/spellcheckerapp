The safety of Northeastern students from vechicular collisions is 
put at risk due to the limited time to cross the street and heavy 
congestion of pedestrians crossing during transition periods. The 
original design was meant to address the issue of pedestrians needing 
to cross a main road in an urban environment with many vehicles. In 
a technical sense, the design was supposssed to rgeulate the most 
safe and efficient way for all students and cars to get to their 
destinations in a timely manner.
